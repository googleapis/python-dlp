    expression.

    For example, given the input
    ``{bucket_name: "mybucket", include_regex: ["directory1/.*"], exclude_regex: ["directory1/excluded.*"]}``:

    -  ``gs://mybucket/directory1/myfile`` will be included
    -  ``gs://mybucket/directory1/directory2/myfile`` will be included
       (``.*`` matches across ``/``)
    -  ``gs://mybucket/directory0/directory1/myfile`` will *not* be
       included (the full path doesn't match any items in
       ``include_regex``)
    -  ``gs://mybucket/directory1/excludedfile`` will *not* be included
       (the path matches an item in ``exclude_regex``)

    If ``include_regex`` is left empty, it will match all files by
    default (this is equivalent to setting ``include_regex: [".*"]``).

    Some other common use cases:

    -  ``{bucket_name: "mybucket", exclude_regex: [".*\.pdf"]}`` will
       include all files in ``mybucket`` except for .pdf files
    -  ``{bucket_name: "mybucket", include_regex: ["directory/[^/]+"]}``
       will include all files directly under
       ``gs://mybucket/directory/``, without matching across ``/``
