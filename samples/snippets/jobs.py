def list_dlp_jobs(project, filter_string=None, job_type=None):
    """Uses the Data Loss Prevention API to lists DLP jobs that match the
        specified filter in the request.
    Args:
        project: The project id to use as a parent resource.
        filter: (Optional) Allows filtering.
            Supported syntax:
            * Filter expressions are made up of one or more restrictions.
            * Restrictions can be combined by 'AND' or 'OR' logical operators.
            A sequence of restrictions implicitly uses 'AND'.
            * A restriction has the form of '<field> <operator> <value>'.
            * Supported fields/values for inspect jobs:
                - `state` - PENDING|RUNNING|CANCELED|FINISHED|FAILED
                - `inspected_storage` - DATASTORE|CLOUD_STORAGE|BIGQUERY
                - `trigger_name` - The resource name of the trigger that
                                   created job.
            * Supported fields for risk analysis jobs:
                - `state` - RUNNING|CANCELED|FINISHED|FAILED
            * The operator must be '=' or '!='.
            Examples:
            * inspected_storage = cloud_storage AND state = done
            * inspected_storage = cloud_storage OR inspected_storage = bigquery
            * inspected_storage = cloud_storage AND
                                  (state = done OR state = canceled)
        type: (Optional) The type of job. Defaults to 'INSPECT'.
            Choices:
            DLP_JOB_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED
            INSPECT_JOB: The job inspected content for sensitive data.
            RISK_ANALYSIS_JOB: The job executed a Risk Analysis computation.

    Returns:
        None; the response from the API is printed to the terminal.
